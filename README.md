## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm a passionate **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** graduate from **Izmir Katip Celebi University** 🇹🇷.  
Throughout my academic journey and internships, I focused on real-time industrial automation systems, PLC programming, embedded systems, and digital transformation with Industry 4.0 technologies.

I completed my **graduation project** on a **Digital Twin system** for a conveyor belt in a marble factory. The system was developed using **Unity 3D**, **ESP32-CAM**, and **PLC (Schneider)** integration over MQTT.  
I love building **real-world industrial solutions** that combine software and hardware to create smart, autonomous systems.
